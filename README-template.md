## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

I learnt how to use grid in css effectively. compare to flexbox, i was able to make changes to my rows and columns at the same time making use of properties like 
-grid area
-grid gap
-grid-template-row
-grid-template-column



### Continued development

i still want to improve more on my mobile-first approach for designing.with the help of grid system in css i was able to design this project with the mobile first technique. I hope to use bootstrsp or tailwind Css for my next project
